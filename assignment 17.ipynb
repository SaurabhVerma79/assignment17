    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style for building web services that use the HTTP\n",
    "protocol to provide data access. It is a lightweight, flexible and scalable\n",
    "architecture that is widely adopted by modern web services. RESTful services \n",

    "operations through simple HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful services also rely on the use of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) \n",
    "to identify resources, and they use a variety of data formats for communication,\n",
    "including JSON and XML. RESTful services are known for their simplicity, scalability,\n",
    "and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a messaging protocol used in web services that rely on XML for communication.\n",
    "It is a complex, heavyweight and rigid architecture that has been around for many years.\n",
    "SOAP is designed around the use of a formal contract or specification called a WSDL \n",
    "(Web Services Description Language) that defines the operations, parameters, and data\n",
    "types used by the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP services provide a set of standardized operations that can be used by any \n",
    "\n",
    "client application that understands the WSDL. It uses a wide variety of protocols \n",
    "for communication, including HTTP, SMTP and FTP. SOAP services are known for their\n",
    "robustness and ability to handle complex transactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP has several disadvantages, including:\n",

    "1-Complexity: SOAP is a complex architecture that can be difficult to use and understand, \n",
    "especially for developers who are new to web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Overhead: SOAP requires a lot of additional XML data for each message, which can \n",
    "increase network traffic and slow down performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Speed: SOAP can be slow, especially compared to RESTful services, which use simpler\n",
    "protocols and data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Compatibility: SOAP can be incompatible with some systems and platforms, especially \n",
    "those that use non-XML data formats.\n",
